description: Choose concise, explanatory, learning or formal presentation for GitLab Workspace answers, progress and work artifacts. Apply when using the installed Wiki, merge or release workflow, or when the user invokes $output-style or requests an output style.

# Output Style

Adapt human-readable output to the current task. This installed Skill replaces the
other workflow Skills' fallback presentation rules; their workflow, evidence and
artifact contracts still govern the work. It does not change host settings.

## Choose the mode

Accept `style=auto|concise|explanatory|learning|formal` in the user's prompt.
An explicit style or natural-language presentation request wins over automatic
selection. Apply it to the requested task; extend it across later tasks only when
the user asks. `style=auto` restores automatic selection. No new CLI option,
review-result field or configuration file is required.

For `auto`, choose separately for each answer or artifact:

| Mode | Use when | Presentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `concise` | Status, direct questions, routine actions and completion replies | State the result first; include the essential evidence, limitation and next action. Simple answers usually need one to three sentences. |
| `explanatory` | Why/how questions, diagnosis, mechanisms and comparisons | Give the answer, then explain the cause or decision using relevant evidence, tradeoffs and a concrete example when useful. |
| `learning` | The user asks to learn, be taught or receive a walkthrough | Explain the relevant concepts and steps while completing the authorized work. Use a worked example or a short optional exercise when helpful. |
| `formal` | Reports, requirements, plans, acceptance records and durable work documents | Use the target artifact's required structure, traceability and level of detail; put the main conclusion in its existing summary or first paragraph. |

A formal artifact and its short chat delivery may use different modes. An
ambiguous ordinary reply defaults to `concise`; an artifact with a required
template uses `formal`. Select silently without adding a mode announcement.
Read [the examples](references/examples.md) when the task mixes modes or an
explicit override could conflict with a required artifact.

## Preserve the work

- Write in Traditional Chinese unless the user or target project specifies another
  language. Keep code, commands, paths, IDs, schema keys, status values and raw
  evidence verbatim.
- Preserve the target artifact's required sections, finding fields, evidence,
  checklists, approval and acceptance records. An explicit style changes prose
  density and explanation, not those requirements.
- Keep every finding, pending confirmation, blocker, coverage gap, limitation,
  material error and required verification result. Distinguish proved facts,
  inference, unexecuted checks and human confirmations. Concision does not change
  a review verdict or turn an incomplete check into a pass.
- Keep raw outputs and literal human responses unchanged in their evidence
  records. Summarize them only where the workflow permits a separate summary.
- Continue the requested work in every mode. Learning adds explanation; it does
  not add approval gates, require the user to implement a step, or leave an
  authorized task unfinished for an exercise.
- Follow the current task's permissions, scope and completion gates. Presentation
  never authorizes additional writes, publication or external actions.
